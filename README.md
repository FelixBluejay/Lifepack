This is a simple Minecraft datapack that adds the three-life system from Grian's Life series.

# Rules:
Each player gets 3 lives. After the third death, they get set to spectator mode.
When a player drops to their last life, their aim is to kill everyone.

# How to set up
- Drop the Lifepack folder into the datapacks folder in your world's directory.
- Run /reload
- Run /function lifepack:initialize

# Additional notes
It is strongly encouraged that players that have 3 or 2 lives not intentionally kill eachother.
I recommend playing with Keep Inventory and a small-ish world border.
Players that joined after the initialization command had been run start the game with 3 lives.
To manually set a player's life value run:
- /scoreboard players set <player> Lives <number>
- /function lifepack:change_team
